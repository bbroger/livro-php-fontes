Are only two classes, Connection() and Crud() with good methods and the basic files from CRUD. You will not have to type any field names and no lines of code. It will automatically generate the code of a CRUD.

- All web server supported by PHP, including native
- MySQL or PostgreSQL (with small adaptations also rotates in the others supported by the PDO)
- Writing permission to the web server in the application folder (on Linux systems or similar)

## Origin

This software started from the application "crud_phpoo" from repository:

https://github.com/ribafs/aplicativos-php

## To change table:

- You can manually edit the classes/connection.php
- Or simply remove the classes/connection.php and call again - http://localhost/auto-app

## Automatic CRUD

Using this software I create another proejct and call auto-crud, which does this same magic but only for one tables.
