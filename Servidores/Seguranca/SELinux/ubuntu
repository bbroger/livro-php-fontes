Installing SELinux
Ubuntu

Starting with Hardy Heron SELinux has been integrated into Ubuntu and can be installed via apt.

    Install the selinux package:

     # apt-get install selinux 

    Change the SELinux mode in /etc/selinux/config (optional):
        Enforcing

         # sudo sed -i 's/SELINUX=.*/SELINUX=enforcing/' /etc/selinux/config 

        Permissive

         # sudo sed -i 's/SELINUX=.*/SELINUX=permissive/' /etc/selinux/config 

    Reboot

During shutdown all of the files on the system will be labeled. This may take some time depending on how many files you have and disk speed.
