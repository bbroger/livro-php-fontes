Don't Do This

<a href="http://example.com" target="_blank">Click here</a>

This lets example.com take control of the current web page.
Do This Instead

<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a>

DON'T DO THIS:

/* Insecure code: */
$query = $pdo->query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" . $_GET['username'] . "'");

Do this instead:

/* Secure against SQL injection: */
$results = $easydb->row("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", $_GET['username']);


echo htmlentities($string, ENT_QUOTES | ENT_HTML5, 'UTF-8'); 
is a safe and effective way to stop all XSS attacks on a UTF-8 encoded web page, but doesn't allow any HTML.

The main mitigation against XXE attacks is as follows:
libxml_disable_entity_loader(true);
