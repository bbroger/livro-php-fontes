================================================================================

 1) Add the following to your Apache configuration, and restart the server:

  ### Add the AcceptPathInfo directive only for Apache 2.0.30 or later.
  Alias /joomla /usr/local/www/joomla3/
  AcceptPathInfo On

  <Directory /usr/local/www/joomla3>
      AllowOverride None
      Order Allow,Deny
      Allow from all
      # For Apache 2.4 add:
      Require all granted
  </Directory>

 2) Visit your Joomla site with a browser (i.e. http://your.server.com/joomla/),
    and you should be taken to the install.php script, which will lead you
    through creating a config.php file and then setting up Joomla, creating
    an admin account, etc.


 3) As of 2.5.5, php5-mysqli and php5-zip are installed. Use of mysqli for mysql
    is recommended over mysql.

 4) As of 3.6.4, php7 is also supported, and the php*-mysql extension is NOT 
    asked for.  Also, the php*-pgsql extension is asked for as Joomla supports
    PostgreSQL as well.
