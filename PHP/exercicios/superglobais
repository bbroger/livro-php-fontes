Superglobals

As seen in this chapter, there are a number of built-in associative arrays that make
external data available to PHP scripts. These arrays are known as superglobals , because
they are automatically available in every scope. There are nine superglobals in PHP, each
of which is described briefly in Table 23-2 .
