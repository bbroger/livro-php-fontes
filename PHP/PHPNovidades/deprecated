As each() loop is deprecated since PHP 7.2, how to update the below while(() = each()) loop without $value? 

I found a way to fix it and thought to share the information. Here are also other cases about how to upgrade each() loops to foreach().
Case 1: Missing $value

reset($array);
while (list($key, ) = each($array)) {

Update to:

foreach(array_keys($array) as $key) {

Case 2: Missing $key

reset($array);
while (list(, $value) = each($array)) {

Update to:

foreach($array as $value) {

Case 3: Not missing anything

reset($array);
while (list($key, $value) = each($array)) {

Update to:

foreach($array as $key => $value) {
